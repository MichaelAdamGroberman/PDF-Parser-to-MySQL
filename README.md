# PDF-Parser-to-MySQL

 Replace 'TableName' and 'ColumnName' with your actual table name and column name where you want to insert data.
The above code only extracts text from PDF files. If your PDF contains tables or images, you might need more sophisticated libraries like PDFMiner or PyMuPDF.
The extraction of text from PDFs depends on how the PDF was created. If the text is embedded as images or the PDF was created from scanned images, you would need OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the text, such as Tesseract or Pytesseract.
It's important to secure your database credentials and not expose them in your script. It is good practice to store them in environment variables or separate config files.
Always handle exceptions and errors, especially when dealing with file and database operations.
This is a simple example. For production use, you may need to handle batch operations, large files, connection pooling etc.
